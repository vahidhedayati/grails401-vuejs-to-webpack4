# grails401-vuejs-to-webpack4
This is a project which will be an initial release of a default grails 4.0.1 
`grails create-app grails401-vuejs-to-webpack4 --profile=vue`

> then followed by another checkin which will include update of client site to be upgraded from webpack 3 to webpack 4


Please note the upgrade has worked with esLint disabled - I presume additional things are needed in webpack config ? I don't use it 

```

./gradlew bootRun --parallel

```
